# Add Code Coverage to Test Suite 📊

## Problem

No code coverage tracking is currently configured for the test suite. Coverage metrics help identify untested code paths and measure test effectiveness.

## Current State

- No `pytest-cov` plugin installed
- No coverage configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- No coverage reporting in CI workflows

## Next Steps

Once coverage is working locally and baseline metrics are established, consider adding coverage reporting to CI workflows.
