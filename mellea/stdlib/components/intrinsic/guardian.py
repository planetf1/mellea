"""Adapter functions for Guardian safety and hallucination detection.

The Guardian adapters (`guardian-core`, `policy-guardrails`,
`factuality-detection`, `factuality-correction`) require a
`<guardian>`-prefixed envelope as the last user message of the request.
That envelope is built from the `instruction:` field of each adapter's
`io.yaml` via :class:`IntrinsicsRewriter`; the helpers below just resolve
any convenience inputs (e.g. :data:`CRITERIA_BANK` lookups) and pass the
resolved kwargs through.
