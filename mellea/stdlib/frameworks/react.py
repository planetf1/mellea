"""ReACT (Reason + Act) agentic pattern implementation.

Provides the `react()` async function, which drives a tool-use loop: the model
reasons about a goal, selects a tool, receives the result as an observation, and
repeats until it calls `final_answer` or the `loop_budget` is exhausted. Accepts
any list of `AbstractMelleaTool` instances and a `ChatContext` for multi-turn
history tracking. Raises `RuntimeError` if the loop ends without a final answer.
