"""ChunkingStrategy, its built-in implementations, and the Chunker driver.

A `ChunkingStrategy` is the stateless "how to split": given text, it returns the
complete chunks and withholds any trailing fragment.

A `Chunker` is the stateful "how far through this stream we are": it wraps a
strategy and drives it incrementally, feeding one delta at a time and holding the
trailing fragment between calls.

    A chunking strategy receives text and returns a list of complete chunks
    ready for downstream validation. Any trailing fragment that has not yet reached
    a chunk boundary is withheld — it is not included in the returned list. Each
    call is stateless and idempotent given the same input.

    End-of-stream contract: `split()` always withholds the trailing fragment;
    `flush()` releases it once no more text is coming.

    Note: this ABC operates on text streams only. Multi-modal output (audio
    segments, image regions) is not supported — the `text: str`
    signatures on `split` and `flush` preclude it.

        The `Chunker` driver calls `split()` with the un-emitted suffix — the

        Strategies must be stateless and idempotent: calling `split()` twice
        with the same input must return the same result. State between deltas
        (e.g. a partial word buffer) is held by the `Chunker`, not the strategy.

        Each returned chunk must be a verbatim substring of `text` and must be
        non-empty; the `Chunker` driver rejects zero-length chunks and chunks
        that are not present verbatim in `text` (e.g. normalised whitespace).
