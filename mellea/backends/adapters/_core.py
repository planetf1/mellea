"""Core adapter scaffolding types (Epic #929 Phase 0).

Introduces the composable `Adapter` dataclass and its three parts:

- :class:`Identity` — name, adapter_type, optional capability
- :class:`IOContract` — ABC for prompt building and output parsing
- :class:`WeightsBinding` — pluggable ABC for weights lifecycle management

Also provides:

- :class:`LocalFileBinding`
- :class:`EmbeddedBinding` — stub :class:`WeightsBinding` subclass
- :class:`ServerMediatedBinding` — stub :class:`WeightsBinding` subclass
- :class:`AdapterSchemaMismatchError`

Note:
    The existing :class:`~mellea.backends.adapters.adapter.Adapter` ABC in
    `adapter.py` is not modified here.  This module introduces a new
    `Adapter` *dataclass* that is re-exported from
    `mellea.backends.adapters`.  Both coexist until shim removal in 4.1.
    The old ABC is not part of the public `__init__.py` surface, so there is
    no namespace collision on the public API.
