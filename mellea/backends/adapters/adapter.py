"""Adapter classes for adding fine-tuned modules to inference backends.

The primary public surface is :func:`AdapterMixin.resolve_adapter` (find or lazily
register an adapter by capability name) and :meth:`AdapterMixin._find_adapter`
(look up a registered adapter).  :class:`AdapterMixin` is mixed into backends that
support runtime adapter loading and unloading.

`LocalHFAdapter`, `IntrinsicAdapter`, and `EmbeddedIntrinsicAdapter` are
**deprecation shims** retained for backwards compatibility.  They satisfy
`isinstance(x, _core.Adapter)` but delegate all behaviour to the new dataclass.
`get_adapter_for_intrinsic` is similarly deprecated; prefer `resolve_adapter`.

        """Context manager wrapping adapter activation and deactivation.

        A no-op when `adapter` is `None`. Otherwise: activates
        `adapter.weights`, yields, then always deactivates — even if the `with`
        body raises. Each phase fires `ADAPTER_FUNCTION_PHASE_COMPLETE`, and
        `ADAPTER_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_COMPLETE` fires on the way out, carrying the
        overall outcome.

        This method fires hooks only; it does not open spans. Span production is a
        plugin's job (see #1464 for the rule and #1466 for the adapter-function
        spans), and the `ADAPTER_FUNCTION_*` family currently has no start hook for
        a plugin to open a span on. Hook dispatch goes through
        `_run_async_in_thread` (no timeout): the dispatching call blocks the
        calling thread, but the hook coroutine itself runs on the shared
        `_EventLoopHandler` event-loop thread. A subscriber that blocks on
        something the dispatching thread is holding deadlocks rather than
        merely stalls — e.g. on `LocalHFBackend`, an intrinsic caller holds
        `_generation_lock` across the whole scope, so a subscriber that
        re-enters any `_generation_lock` path blocks the event-loop thread
        while its owner waits on that same event loop, and reentrance cannot
        bridge the gap. Even without such re-entry, a slow or blocking-mode
        `ADAPTER_FUNCTION_*` subscriber delays whatever holds this scope open.

        `deactivate()` is guarded on `activate()`'s own side effect having
        completed, not on the activate phase's hook dispatch also succeeding.
        If a plugin subscribed to `ADAPTER_FUNCTION_PHASE_COMPLETE` raises after
        `activate()` already flipped the adapter on, `deactivate()` still runs —
        telemetry must not be able to strand the adapter active.

        Not atomic across the whole scope **by itself**: `_adapter_activation_lock()`
        is held only inside each of `activate()`/`deactivate()`'s own verb calls
        (see `LocalFileBinding.activate`), not for the `with` body in between.
        Two concurrent `adapter_scope()` calls on one backend can therefore
        interleave — one thread's body can run while a different adapter is
        active, activated by another thread's call — unless the caller closes
        that gap itself. Widening *this method's own* lock to span the whole
        scope was tried and reverted: it deadlocks the moment the body does
        real async generation from the thread that opened the scope, because
        that work runs on the shared event-loop thread while this thread holds
        the lock — a same-thread `RLock` doesn't help across threads.

        `LocalHFBackend._generate_intrinsic_with_adapter_scope` is the reference
        example of a caller that *does* close the gap for its own call site: it
        holds `_generation_lock` around the entire scope, which is safe there
        only because the scope *body* is fully synchronous end to end and
        does no async generation work on the event loop (its only loop
        traffic during the scope is the hook dispatches described above —
        one-way submissions, not re-entry into this backend) — concurrent
        invocations simply land on different threads and serialise on the
        lock, rather than one thread holding it while another does async work
        on the loop. A caller whose
        body awaits work that re-enters generation on another thread must not
        widen a lock this way — that reproduces the deadlock above.

        A caller composing `adapter_scope()` with `LocalHFBackend`'s *standard*
        (non-intrinsic) generation path still silently ignores it: that path
        (`_generate_with_adapter_lock`) always deactivates any adapter before
        generating, so wrapping `generate_from_context()` in `adapter_scope()`
        activates the adapter, generates against the base model anyway, then
        deactivates. Pre-existing, not specific to the intrinsic path this
        method now supports.

        Use :class:`~mellea.backends.adapters.Adapter` directly.
        `EmbeddedIntrinsicAdapter` will be removed in a future release
        (Epic #929, issue #1144).

    Unlike PEFT-based adapters that are loaded into the model at runtime,
    embedded adapters are already baked into the model weights and activated
    via control tokens injected by the model's chat template.  Only the I/O
    transformation config (`io.yaml`) is needed; no adapter weights are
    downloaded or loaded.

    Args:
        intrinsic_name (str): Name of the adapter function (e.g. `"answerability"`).
        config (dict): Parsed I/O transformation configuration (from `io.yaml`).
        technology (str): Adapter technology in the switch model — `"lora"` or
            `"alora"`.  Determines where the control token is placed in the
            chat template (beginning of sequence for LoRA, before generation
            prompt for aLoRA).

    Attributes:
        intrinsic_name (str): Name of the adapter function this adapter implements.
        config (dict): Parsed I/O transformation configuration.
        technology (str): `"lora"` or `"alora"`.

    Note:
        `identity`, `io_contract`, and `weights` are internal scaffolding
        populated in `__init__` to satisfy the `Adapter` protocol; they are
        not meaningful consumer-facing attributes.

        - `identity`: always a real value.

        - `io_contract`: the real, declared contract for `intrinsic_name`
          (issue #1516); no longer a placeholder.

        - `weights`: a real `EmbeddedBinding`; activation runs through it.
