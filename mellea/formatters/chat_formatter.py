"""`ChatFormatter` for converting context histories to chat-message lists.

`ChatFormatter` is the standard formatter used by mellea's legacy backends. Its
`to_chat_messages` method linearises a sequence of `Component` and `CBlock`
objects into `Message` objects with `user`, `assistant`, or `tool` roles,
handling `ModelOutputThunk` responses, image attachments, and parsed structured
outputs. Concrete backends call this formatter when preparing input for a chat
completion endpoint.

        """Convert a linearized chat history into a list of chat messages.

        Iterates over each element in the context history and converts it to a
        `Message` with an appropriate role. `ModelOutputThunk` instances are
        treated as assistant responses, while all other `Component` and
        `CBlock` objects default to the `user` role. A `Component` may override
        this positional guess by setting `role` on the `TemplateRepresentation`
        returned from its `format_for_llm`, and a component with `role="tool"`
        may additionally declare `tool_call_id`/`tool_name`, which are carried
        onto the resulting `Message`. Image attachments and parsed structured
        outputs are handled transparently.

        Args:
            cs (list[Span]): The linearized sequence of context
                components, content blocks, and model outputs to convert.

                a chat completion endpoint.

                `TemplateRepresentation`) outside `Message.Role`; role
