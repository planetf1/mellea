"""``Requirement`` interface for constrained and validated generation.

A ``Requirement`` pairs a human-readable description with a validation function that
inspects a ``Context`` (and optionally a backend) to determine whether a model output
meets a constraint. ``ValidationResult`` carries the pass/fail verdict along with an
optional reason, score, and the ``ModelOutputThunk`` produced during validation.
``PartialValidationResult`` provides a tri-state variant (``"pass"``, ``"fail"``,
``"unknown"``) for per-chunk streaming validation.
Helper factories such as ``default_output_to_bool`` make it easy to build requirements
without boilerplate.
