        'same players as on Feeling the Space, dubbed "The Plastic U.F.Ono Band". '
        "Around the time of the album's release in November, Lennon moved to Los "

        "The sessions for Rock 'n' Roll were extremely troubled, and the sessions were "
        "abandoned until a later date. In July 1974, Lennon returned to New York to "
        'record Walls and Bridges. The new "Plastic Ono Nuclear Band" featured both '
        "old and new faces, with Jim Keltner, Kenneth Ascher, and Arthur Jenkins "
        "continuing from Mind Games, the returns of Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, and "
        "Bobby Keys, and the addition of guitarists Jesse Ed Davis and Eddie Mottau. "

        "the birth of his son Sean. The compilation Shaved Fish was released in October "

        "Ono's return to music in 1980 for the album Double Fantasy, they played with "
        "an all-new group of studio musicians who were not billed as any variation of "

        text="John Winston Ono Lennon  (9 October 1940 - 8 December 1980) was an English "
        "singer, songwriter, and peace activist who co-founded the Beatles, the most "
        "commercially successful band in the history of popular music. He and fellow "
        "member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along "
        "with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group would ascend to world-wide "
        "fame during the 1960s. During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son "
        "Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were "
        "intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles "
        "when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother "
        "Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced "
        "that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial "
        "success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years "
        'later, "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my '
        "watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I "
        "knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky "
        "with diamonds.'\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it "
        "was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon "
        "insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\" McCartney corroborated Lennon's "
        "explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant "
        "from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car "
        "journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed "
        'a song, "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song '
        '"Hey Jude". Lennon later said, "That\'s his best song. It started off as a '
        "song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought "
        "it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\" Lennon's relationship with "
        "Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to Manhattan in "
        "1971, Julian would not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's "
        "encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit "
        "Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see "
        "his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and "
        "Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, "
        "and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. "
        'Julian recalls that he and his father "got on a great deal better" during the '
        'time he spent in New York: "We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great '
        'time in general." In a Playboy interview with David Sheff shortly before his '
        'death, Lennon said, "Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference. '
        "I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came "
        "from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's "
        'here, he belongs to me, and he always will." He said he was trying to '
        "re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, "
        '"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future." After his death it was '
        "revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.",
