    "The Gregorian calendar's oldest ancestor, the first Roman calendar, had "
    "10 months instead of 12. Roman king Numa Pompilius added January and "
    "February to sync the calendar with the lunar year. He wanted to avoid even "
    "numbers due to Roman superstition and subtracted a day from each of the 30-day "
    "months to make them 29. The lunar year consists of 355 days, and at least "
    "1 month out of the 12 needed to contain an even number of days. Numa chose "
    "February, a month that would be host to Roman rituals honoring the dead, as "
    "the unlucky month to consist of 28 days. Despite changes in the calendar, "
    "February's 28-day length has stuck.\\n\\nFebruary has 28 days due to Roman "
    "superstition. The Roman calendar originally divided the year from March to "
    "December into 10 months of either 29 or 31 days, based on lunar cycles. Later, "
    "January and February were added to cover the full year. The Romans considered "
    "even numbers unlucky, so February was chosen to have 28 days as this was "
    "when they honored their dead. Despite changes to the calendar, February's "
    "unique 28-day length survived.\\n\\nThe Gregorian calendar's oldest ancestor, "
    "the first Roman calendar, had a glaring difference in structure from its "
    "later variants: it consisted of 10 months rather than 12. The Roman king "
    "Numa Pompilius added January and February to the original 10 months. "
    "However, Numa wanted to avoid having even numbers in his calendar, as Roman "
    "superstition at the time held that even numbers were unlucky. He subtracted a "
    "day from each of the 30-day months to make them 29. The lunar year consists of "
    "355 days, which meant that he now had 56 days left to work with. In the end, "
    "at least 1 month out of the 12 needed to contain an even number of days. So "
    "Numa chose February, a month that would be host to Roman rituals honoring "
    "the dead, as the unlucky month to consist of 28 days.\\n\\nThe Roman calendar "
    "was originally established by Romulus and consisted of ten months, each "
    "having 30 or 31 days. The calendar was then revised by Numa Pompilius, who "
    "divided winter between the two months of January and February, shortened "
    "most other months, and brought everything into alignment with the solar "
    "year by some system of intercalation. The calendar was lunisolar and had "
    "important days such as kalends, nones, and ides, which seem to have derived "
    "from the new moon, the first-quarter moon, and the full moon respectively. "
    "The calendar was conservatively maintained until the Late Republic, but "
    "intercalation was not always observed, causing the civil calendar to vary "
    "from the solar year. Caesar reformed the calendar in 46 BC, creating the "
    "Julian calendar, which was an entirely solar one. The Julian calendar was "
    "designed to have a single leap day every fourth year.\\n\\nThe month of "
    "February was named after the purification rituals of ancient Rome, not the "
    "Roman god of war, Mars. The name February comes from the Latin februare, "
    'meaning \\"to purify.\\"\\n\\nThe ancient Romans believed that even '
    "numbers were unlucky, which is why February has 28 days instead of 30. They "
    "preferred to have more 31-day months.\\n\\nFebruary has 28 days due to "
    "Roman superstition. The Roman calendar originally divided the year into "
    "10 months of either 29 or 31 days, based on lunar cycles. Later, January "
    "and February were added to cover the full year. The Romans considered even "
    "numbers unlucky, so February was chosen to have 28 days as this was when they "
    "honored their dead. This unique 28-day length survived the changes from "
    "the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.\\n\\nFebruary's 28 days date back to "
    "the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius. Before he became king, Rome's "
    "lunar calendar was just 10 months long, beginning in March and ending in "
    "December. The time between December and March was considered unimportant "
    "as it had nothing to do with the harvest. When Numa Pompilius took reign, "
    "he decided to make the calendar more accurate by lining it up with the year's "
    "12 lunar cycles. He added January and February to the end of the calendar. "
    "Because Romans believed even numbers to be unlucky, each month had an odd "
    "number of days, which alternated between 29 and 31. However, to reach "
    "355 days, one month had to be an even number. February was chosen to be "
    "the unlucky month with 28 days. This choice may be due to the fact that "
    "Romans honored the dead and performed rites of purification in "
    "February.\\n\\nThe ancient Romans believed that even numbers were evil and "
    "they tried to make every month have an odd number of days. However, they "
    "couldn't do this for February, making it the only month with an even number "
    "of days. The reason behind this belief is not explained in the provided context."
