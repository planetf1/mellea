"""How `ALoraRequirement` routes validation through a fast adapter.

Uses the catalog-native `requirement-check` adapter (registered here via
`IntrinsicAdapter`, still the only working way to drive `_generate_from_intrinsic` —
see #1144) to compare aLoRA-backed validation against full LLM-as-judge generation
for the same requirement. `LLMaJRequirement` is used for the comparison because
`ALoraRequirement` always routes through the registered adapter regardless of
`backend.default_to_constraint_checking_alora`.

For loading a fully custom, non-catalog adapter with your own output schema
(not the generic `{"requirement_check": {"score": ...}}` shape), see
`stembolts_intrinsic.py` in this directory — it has no standalone entry point of
its own; `102_example.py` drives it interactively (reads from stdin, so it isn't
runnable as an automated example).

# json.JSONDecodeError (it is not JSON), and a JSON reply that doesn't match
# the schema raises AdapterSchemaMismatchError — either way the error
# propagates out of validate() instead of returning a failed check. The ALORA
# type is also load-bearing here: routing only looks up ("alora",), so
# registering the LORA variant instead would hit the same failure.
